## How We Collaborated

We used:
GitHub for all code (Jupyter Notebooks, or .py files, and that cursed requirements.txt)
PRs & commits show individual contributions 
Slides (Google Slides): Linked above, each section labeled by contributor
OneDrive: Sharing documents

## Data analysis
Hypothesis 1: Avoidance via Delay in Approaching Food
Variables:
   seconds_after_rat_arrival — split into short vs long delay (e.g., below/above median)
    test: compare bat_landing_to_food (how much they hesitate after landing)
Hypotheses :
     H0: Bats take equally long to approach food regardless of how soon they land after rats arrive.
    H1: Bats take longer to approach food when they land soon after rat arrival ( vigilance). Hypothesis 2:  Rat Presence Reduces Bat Traffic

Hypothesis 2: Rat Presence Reduces Bat Traffic
Variables:
test:
     High vs. Low rat_minutes
Compare:
    bat_landing_number
Hypotheses:
    H0: Rats being around doesn't affect how many bats come.
    H1: Bats land less often when rats dominate the platform.
