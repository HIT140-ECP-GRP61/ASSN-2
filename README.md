## How We Collaborated

We used:<br />
GitHub for all code (Jupyter Notebooks, or .py files, and that cursed requirements.txt)<br />
PRs & commits show individual contributions <br />
Slides (Google Slides): Linked above, each section labeled by contributor<br />
OneDrive: Sharing documents<br />

## Data analysis
First calculate with 95% CI the mean bat_landing_to_food and bat_landing_number is what<br />
Hypothesis 1: Avoidance via Delay in Approaching Food<br />
Variables:<br />
   seconds_after_rat_arrival — split into short vs long delay (e.g., below/above median)<br />
    test: compare bat_landing_to_food (how much they hesitate after landing)<br />
Hypotheses :<br />
     H0: Bats take equally long to approach food regardless of how soon they land after rats arrive.<br />
    H1: Bats take longer to approach food when they land soon after rat arrival ( vigilance).<br />

Hypothesis 2: Rat Presence Reduces Bat Traffic<br />
Variables:<br />
test:<br />
     High vs. Low rat_minutes<br />
Compare:<br />
    bat_landing_number<br />
Hypotheses:<br />
    H0: Rats being around doesn't affect how many bats come.<br />
    H1: Bats land less often when rats dominate the platform. <br />
